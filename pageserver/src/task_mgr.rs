//!
//! This module provides centralized handling of tokio tasks in the Page Server.
//!
//! We provide a few basic facilities:
//! - A global registry of tasks that lists what kind of tasks they are, and
//!   which tenant or timeline they are working on
//!
//! - The ability to request a task to shut down.
//!
//!
//! # How it works?
//!
//! There is a global hashmap of all the tasks (`TASKS`). Whenever a new
//! task is spawned, a PageServerTask entry is added there, and when a
//! task dies, it removes itself from the hashmap. If you want to kill a
//! task, you can scan the hashmap to find it.
//!
//! # Task shutdown
//!
//! To kill a task, we rely on co-operation from the victim. Each task is
//! expected to periodically call the `is_shutdown_requested()` function, and
//! if it returns true, exit gracefully. In addition to that, when waiting for
//! the network or other long-running operation, you can use
//! `shutdown_watcher()` function to get a Future that will become ready if
//! the current task has been requested to shut down. You can use that with
//! Tokio select!().
//!
//! TODO: This would be a good place to also handle panics in a somewhat sane way.
//! Depending on what task panics, we might want to kill the whole server, or
//! only a single tenant or timeline.
//!

// Clippy 1.60 incorrectly complains about the tokio::task_local!() macro.
// Silence it. See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/9224.

//
// There are four runtimes:
//
// Compute request runtime
//  - used to handle connections from compute nodes. Any tasks related to satisfying
//    GetPage requests, base backups, import, and other such compute node operations
//    are handled by the Compute request runtime
//  - page_service.rs
//  - this includes layer downloads from remote storage, if a layer is needed to
//    satisfy a GetPage request
//
// Management request runtime
//  - used to handle HTTP API requests
//
// WAL receiver runtime:
//  - used to handle WAL receiver connections.
//  - and to receiver updates from storage_broker
//
// Background runtime
//  - layer flushing
//  - garbage collection
//  - compaction
//  - remote storage uploads
//  - initial tenant loading
//
// Everything runs in a tokio task. If you spawn new tasks, spawn it using the correct
// runtime.
//
// There might be situations when one task needs to wait for a task running in another
// Runtime to finish. For example, if a background operation needs a layer from remote
// storage, it will start to download it. If a background operation needs a remote layer,
// and the download was already initiated by a GetPage request, the background task
// will wait for the download - running in the Page server runtime - to finish.
// Another example: the initial tenant loading tasks are launched in the background ops
// runtime. If a GetPage request comes in before the load of a tenant has finished, the
// GetPage request will wait for the tenant load to finish.
//
// The core Timeline code is synchronous, and uses a bunch of std Mutexes and RWLocks to
// protect data structures. Let's keep it that way. Synchronous code is easier to debug
// and analyze, and there's a lot of hairy, low-level, performance critical code there.
//
// It's nice to have different runtimes, so that you can quickly eyeball how much CPU
// time each class of operations is taking, with 'top -H' or similar.
//
// It's also good to avoid hogging all threads that would be needed to process
// other operations, if the upload tasks e.g. get blocked on locks. It shouldn't
// happen, but still.
